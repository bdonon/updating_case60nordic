# Updating case60nordic

This small repo aims at improving the case60nordic power grids by doing
the following :
- Give each object a name and coordinates for better readability.
- Adapt power injections to prevent overflows.
- Produce 3 versions of the same grid, with increasingly complex high 
voltage issues.

More info in the [notebook](Updating%20case60nordic.ipynb).

The resulting data serve as input to a data generating repo :
[powerdatagen](https://github.com/bdonon/powerdatagen).

Figures can also be found in the figures/ directory.
